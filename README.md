# Polymorphism in JavaScript

## Definition

Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same type through a shared interface. In JavaScript, this is typically achieved through inheritance, method overriding, and duck typing.

Polymorphism enables flexibility in code, allowing a single function or method to process objects differently based on their type.

## Why Use Polymorphism?
Code Reusability: Write generic code that works for different object types.
Scalability: Add new types with minimal changes to existing code.
Flexibility: Focus on what objects do rather than how they do it
